## Overview

Before I post the current PerMa Conjuration tree, I shall provide you with some general notes on how magic in general differs between vanilla Skyrim/SkyRe and PerMa.

## Spells as tools

I didn't like how vanilla spell Z often turned out to be nothing but a stronger version of vanilla spell Y, and PerMa is quite a bit better at keeping all spells useful by providing distinct functionality for each one.

This concept also transfers to perks a lot more. The simple passive boosts still have their place, but many perks add new functionality, sometimes aiming to eliminate a spell group's weaknesses. As an example, there are no "Frost spells are x% stronger" perks in PerMa. However, there are perks that add a physical damage component, and that make the physical damage component grow specifically against targets that resist frost damage.

## Spell cost scaling

In PerMa, spell casting cost will, in general, not scale. There are some exceptions that allow you to lower casting cost, but these are rare. Most notably...

* ... the "Novice, Apprentice...." line of perks in every spell school tree will not reduce cost. Instead, these perks grant a random spell when chosen and serve as prerequisites for other perks. To make sure you notice a difference, I altered their name slightly.
* ... enchantments will not lower cost, but boost magnitude/duration instead.
* ... skill level will not lower cost, but boost magnitude/duration instead.

Spell casting cost is reworked with that in mind.

Reasoning? Cost reduction encourages spell spam, and I just think that's not cool. It might be cool every now and then, but it's not a good design principle for _every_ spell in _every_ school of magic.

## "Focus" perks

If you've watched the youtube videos, you've seen some fancy spells that look waaaay too strong. These spells are tied to so-called "Focus" perks. Here's a rundown on how they work:

* Each spell school contains two "Focus" perks
* Focus perks require skill level 95 and the tree's "Studies: Master XXX" perk to be selectable
* Focus perks are mutually exclusive across trees; each character may only choose one.
* Exception: Alteration has a special perk called "Architect of Magic". Selecting this perk raises the maximum number of selectable "Focus" perks by 1.
* Focus perks may grant passive boosts, spells, abilities, and any combination. None of them grant only passive boosts.
* Spells granted by "Focus" perks are _strong_, but are a lot more expensive to cast than regular master level spells, and they may carry downsides.

So, why did I include such a mechanic?

I really love specialization and individuality across characters, and I want some epicness for my mages. "Focus" perks help in both departments.

Each of those perks represents full mastery of a certain branch, or multiple related branches, within a spell school. Some are based on popular archetypes ("Necromancer", "Demon Summoner"), others are not. Using the tools they give you is meant to make you, as the player, feel awesome, and fully in tune with the things your character has learned on his road.

As an example - remember how the only vital Conjuration perk in vanilla Skyrim (Twin Souls) was accessible for both Daedra-summoners and necromancers? Both branches shared their climax, and that climax was a passive boost! The necromancer could grab Twin Souls, a Dremora Lord spell, and suddenly be an awesome summoner- just as if he'd been summoning all his life.

Yeah, I don't like that. And "Focus" perks are, game design-wise, the exact opposite. Want to overpower all other summoners on Nirn? Then better invest in summoning. And once you're done, feel like you truly could kill Whiterun alone.

Keep this in mind when I post trees. I will not explain what perks like "Studies: Novice Destruction" do, and I will not repeat the rules for "Focus" perks.
