	expensive than regular leather items. The recipes for quality leather and quality leather
	strips do not show up if you lack the ingredients.
	
	If you also have Leather Smithing, quality leather and quality leather strips can be used
	to create quality variants of all craftable armor that has the material leather. Quality
	leather armor variants provide 30% more armor, are 10% lighter and 150% more expensive
	than their basic counterparts.
	
	Quality leather armor needs the same crafting materials as the regular variants, with
	all regular leather/leather strips replaced by their quality counterparts. The recipe
	will only show up if you have the Material: Leather perk, at least one quality leather
	(should the recipe need it) and at least one quality leather strip (should the recipe
